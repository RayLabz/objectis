# Objectis
An object-oriented data access API for Redis cache.

Objectis is a Java library that allows you to quickly manage data in Redis in an object-oriented way.
Through Objectis, you can easily save, retrieve, list, delete and filter _objects_ instead of Strings
or raw data within your Redis cache.

Objectis is built on and can utilize the [Jedis](https://github.com/redis/jedis) library.
